# Seeds ANN Project

This project builds and evaluates a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for a multiclass classification task using the UCI Seeds dataset. The dataset contains seven numerical features describing geometric properties of wheat kernels, along with a target label indicating one of three wheat varieties.

## Project Overview

Throughout this project, we will:

* Perform data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Preprocess the dataset using train/test splitting and feature scaling.
* Design and train a multilayer ANN using Keras/TensorFlow.
* Compare two model variants by modifying a key hyperparameter.
* Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Produce a structured Jupyter Notebook and a final 3-page written report summarizing methods and findings.

This repository contains all required code, documentation, and structure to complete the assignment end-to-end.
